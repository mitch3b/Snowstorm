Mitch's addition:
There is now a green screen version used for things like streaming in OBS

//Default values
excludeMobile = false;
vMaxX = 28;
vMaxY = 15;
animationInterval = 33;
flakesMax = 128;
flakesMaxActive = 128;
useTwinkleEffect = false;
followMouse = false;

To set to your own value, include as an html parameter with the same name as above, for example:
https://mitch3b.github.io/Snowstorm/greenScreen.html?vMaxX=100&vMaxY=1&useTwingleEffect=true

To use in OBS, create a clr browser with the url above (with or without the params) and include a chroma key.

Enjoy!
